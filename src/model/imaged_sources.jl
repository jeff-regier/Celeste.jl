Attributes of the patch of sky surrounding a single
celestial object in a single image.

Attributes:
  - center: The approximate source location in world coordinates
  - radius_pix: The width of the influence of the object in pixel coordinates
  - psf: The point spread function in this region of the sky
  - wcs_jacobian: The jacobian of the WCS transform in this region of the
                  sky for each band
  - pixel_center: The pixel location of center in each band.

Choose a reasonable patch radius based on the catalog.

Args:
  - ce: The catalog entry for the object

  - width_scale: A multiple of standard deviations to use
  - max_radius: The maximum radius in pixels.

Returns:
  - A radius in pixels chosen from the catalog entry.
